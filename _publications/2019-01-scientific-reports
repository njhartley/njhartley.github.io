title: "[Evidence for Crystalline Structure in Dynamically-Compressed Polyethylene up to 200 GPa](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40782-5)"
permalink: /publication/2019-01-scientific-reports
excerpt: 'We investigated the high-pressure behavior of polyethylene (CH2) by probing dynamically-compressed samples with X-ray diffraction. At pressures up to 200 GPa, comparable to those present inside icy giant planets (Uranus, Neptune), shock-compressed polyethylene retains a polymer crystal structure, from which we infer the presence of significant covalent bonding.'
