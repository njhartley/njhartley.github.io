Research Skills
======

* **Management & Leadership**: Written multiple succesful proposals to internationally competitive facilities, including an ongoing collaboration developing 2-color X-ray heating as an approach to generating HED states. Led beamtimes at SACLA, European XFEL and LCLS, in each case managing international and interdisciplinary teams to collect, analyze and publish the results
* **X-Ray Diffraction**: Used X-ray diffraction with ordered (crysalline) and amorphous (plastic) samples, looking at changes in material properties and the formation of new structures under shock compression and heating; previously used diffraction as an ion temperature diagnostic in experiments at Titan and Phelix
* **X-Ray Scattering**: Analyzed Thomson Scattering data from LCLS experiments, including spatially and energy-resolved spectra; looked at characteristic state features in data on an experiment studying high pressure phase transitions
* **Analysis/Modelling**: Modelled and analyzed data using techniques such as radiation hydrodynamics, XRTS codes, molecular dynamics and density functional theory as well as home-built simulations and codes
* **Optical Diagnostics**: Published Visar data from double-shock compressed samples using self-impedance mismatch; previously installed and used Visar and streaked optical pyrometry diagnostics at the SACLA facility and elsewhere
* **Service to the Community**: Served as chair of the LCLS User Executive Committee 2023-24, which works with the facility senior management to address concerns from the users. Serve as an APS Career Mentoring Fellow, working with students and early career scientists to help them find career paths in physics. Mentored undergraduate summer student interns, with their work contributing to to a published article
