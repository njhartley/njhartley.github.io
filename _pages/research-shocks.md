# Shock-Compression of Light Elements

<br>Using a large laser system, we can drive samples to the same conditions that exist inside giant planets. The laser pulses  shock the target, which both heats and compresses it to the relevant condition, then probing it using X-rays. The best results come from X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) facilities such as [LCLS](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/) or [SACLA](http://xfel.riken.jp/eng/), which can deliver extremely bright pulses on incredibly short timescales.


## Computational Modelling

<br>Alongside practical work, and together with my colleagues, I work on predicting the conditions and behaviour of the materials in the experiments. By comparing the experimental data with simulated results, we are able to both improve our models, and understand more about the material than can be directly observed.
