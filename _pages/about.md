I'm a postdoctoral researcher working in the field of High Energy Density Science (HEDS). Since completing my DPhil in the UK, 
I've worked at [Osaka University](https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en), the [Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR)](https://www.hzdr.de/), 
and am now based at [SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/).

You can learn more about my [current work](https://njhartley.github.io/research/), or see my latest [publications](https://njhartley.github.io/publications/). 
If you want a copy of any of the non-open-access papers, feel free to drop me an email.
